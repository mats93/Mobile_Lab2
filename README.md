# Android - Simple RSS and/or Atom NEWS reader
Lab 2 in the course IMT3673-2019 (Mobile Programming) at NTNU Gjøvik.

## The idea: 
An application that allows the user to read content from any RSS feed.

The app will consist of 3 activities:    
 * List of items (ListView/RecyclerView, for selecting content)
 * Article content display (for reading content)
 * User Preferences (for user to specify the preferences)
